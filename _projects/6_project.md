**Identifying Key Research and Management Priorities for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands**

Island ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and other environmental stressors. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) represent a unique and complex system, both socially and ecologically. Our project aims to identify the most pressing themes and research questions for the effective management and conservation of the ANI. To achieve this, we conducted a comprehensive survey involving researchers and stakeholders who live or work in the region. Through this effort, we aim to provide actionable insights that can guide future research and policy-making in the ANI.
