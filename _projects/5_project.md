**Monitoring Elasmobranchs and Marine Ecosystems at Malvan, Maharashtra**

Since 2016, Dakshin Foundation has been actively monitoring elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and skates) caught in fisheries along the west coast of India at Malvan, Maharashtra. In 2018, we launched an informal program to provide Master's students with the opportunity to conduct their thesis research on elasmobranchs at Malvan. Over the years, this initiative has expanded to encompass additional research areas, including microplastic pollution in fish and sharks, elasmobranch diets, reproductive biology, and heavy metal contamination.

Our team has also developed and is testing user-friendly protocols for monitoring elasmobranch populations in collaboration with local fishers. In addition to our research, we engage in extensive outreach activities with fishing communities and schools, fostering awareness and education about marine conservation in the region.
