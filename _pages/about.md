While I’m trained as an ecologist, I also recognise that humans are part of natural systems and I try incorporating this philosophy in all aspects of my work. My research deals with how the behaviour of individual animals creates and affects large scale patterns in ecosystems. I’m particularly interested in how humans who interact with these system alter processes at multiple scales. I’ve worked on a variety of taxa in different systems including birds, butterflies, sea snakes, sharks and now, reef fish however, anthropogenic change has been the central theme of my work. 

I’m currently pursuing my Ph.D. as a Prime Minister's Research Fellow at the Center for Ecological Sciences, IISc, Bangalore. At Dakshin Foundation, I help manage the sharks and rays’ projects, our long-term engagement at Malvan, Maharashtra and contribute to ongoing projects in the Andaman Islands. 

My full CV is available [here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).
